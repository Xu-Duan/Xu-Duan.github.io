I am a **Master‚Äôs student in Mechanical Engineering** at **The University of Texas at Austin**, specializing in **Dynamic Systems and Control**. I am co-advised by [Dr. Eric van Oort](https://www.pge.utexas.edu/facultystaff/faculty-directory/vanoort) and [Dr. Dongmei Chen](https://www.me.utexas.edu/people/faculty-directory/chen), and currently serve as a **Research Assistant** in the **RAPID Group**, focusing on **well hydraulics, thermodynamics, and intelligent control systems** for drilling operations.

My research bridges **control theory, computational fluid dynamics, and scientific machine learning**, with a particular emphasis on:
- Multiphase flow modeling and numerical simulation using the **Finite Volume Method (FVM)**,
- **Model Predictive Control (MPC)** and **Iterative Learning Control (ILC)** for complex nonlinear processes,
- **Physics-informed flow matching** and **trajectory-optimized density control** inspired by **Optimal Transport (OT)** and **Schr√∂dinger Bridge (SB)** theory.

I am passionate about developing **physics-grounded, data-driven algorithms** that unify model-based reasoning and machine learning for dynamic system optimization.

### üî¨ Research Highlights

- **Trajectory-Optimized Density Control with Flow Matching**  
  Developed a novel trajectory-optimized flow-matching framework that unifies **OT** and **SB** principles for multi-agent density control. Demonstrated collision-free transport and computational efficiency comparable to standard flow-matching algorithms.  
  [arXiv:2510.06666](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06666)

- **Model Predictive Control for Geothermal Drilling (NOV Collaboration)**  
  Designed a physics-based MPC framework integrating thermodynamics and reduced-order modeling via **SINDy**, achieving stable control of **bottomhole pressure and temperature** in HPHT and geothermal environments.

- **Sequential Quadratic Programming Iterative Learning Control (SQP-ILC)**  
  Proposed an SQP-based ILC scheme for nonlinear **roll-to-roll manufacturing**, rigorously handling input constraints and nonlinear peeling dynamics. Experimentally validated on a graphene dry-transfer testbed.  
  [DOI:10.1115/1.4069342](https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4069342)

- **Hydraulic Forces Induced by Drillstring Whirling and Rotation Dynamics**  
  Conducted **CFD simulations** using the **Finite Volume Method** to quantify coupled **fluid‚Äìstructure interactions** in drilling systems, improving understanding of dynamic stability under whirling motion.
